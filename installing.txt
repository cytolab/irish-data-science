Installing Packages

This section usually takes 10 to 30 minutes to download and install several packages of code. These code packages allow R to work with flow cytometry standard (FCS) files, make figures, and implement useful algorithms, including t-SNE, UMAP, FlowSOM, and MEM.  

You may see a stop sign in the console window as the packages install and a download window. That is usually good. You should make sure your CONSOLE is visible. It may ask if you want to replace "all/some/none a/s/n".  
In this case, type "a" in the console and press ENTER to update all.

After installing in each section, please check the output or console window.  You will likely see a lot of text and potentially some scary red text.  If the text is a WARNING, that's OK. If the text indicates there was an ERROR, we need to solve it.

You only need to install the packages once. You don't need to run this Rmarkdown file before each analysis, but it's not a bad idea to update things once in a while.
