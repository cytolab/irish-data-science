This section is meant as an orientation for users who are new to R.  
The contents of this file print as part of one of the CHUNKS of setup code in an Rmarkdown script.
Thus, you should be reading this within an Rmarkdown file from RStudio, not a TXT reader.

To run a LINE of code, press CTRL-ENTER and you will execute the current or next line of code. [For Mac users, you will press COMMAND instead of CTRL]
To run a CHUNK of code, press CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER and you will run the current or next chunk.

Pressing CONTROL-ENTER in this script window is a shortcut to type that line in the CONSOLE below.
When code is running for a while, you will see install bars or a red stop sign.

You will first need to install the following for this course:

1) R, a stats programming environment that is primarily command line. 
(Command line means typing instructions in a CONSOLE vs. a graphical user interface or GUI.)

Download and install the R version for your OS here:
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/

2) RStudio, hopefully what you are reading this in), a GUI for R.  

Download and install the FREE Rstudio here:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

3) Windows users need RTools for some algorithms.

Windows users download and install RTools 3.5 or later here:
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

4) Mac users need Xcode developer tools for some algorithms.

In Finder, go to the Applications folder --> Utilities folder --> select Terminal. A new window should open up. Copy and paste, or type, the following text to the right of the $ in that new window:  

xcode-select --install

5) Mac users may also need the X11/XQuartz program, which allows window control.

Mac users download XQuartz-2.7.11.dmg for OS X 10.6.3 or later here:
https://www.xquartz.org/

5) You may also be interested in Shiny, a web app framework for R.

Please download and install the latest R, RStudio, and RTools now.

Most of the time experienced people struggle with R and MEM, they need to re-install R and RStudio.
If you have an old version, please download and install the latest (vs. "updating").
This will help ensure you're using the same version.  We've seen the updates be a little buggy.

Lines here that start with the # symbol are COMMENTED OUT -- they do not get executed.
You can take notes in the script if you comment out that line by putting # at the start.
You can also comment or uncomment a block of code with CTRL-SHIFT-C.

Windows Users:
We recommend running RStudio as an administrator to avoid issues with permissions for files.
To run RStudio as an administrator, right click the icon and choose "Run as Administrator"
You can also right click the icon, choose "Properties", then in the "Shortcut" tab, then
click the "Advanced" button and check "Run as Administrator" to always run as admin.

You can be stylish and hide this output by changing the line in this CHUNK of R code to:
results = "hide" (at the start it will say results = "markup")
